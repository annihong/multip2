Description: Multiplex extension to the p2 (van Duijn et al., 2004) model which includes cross-layer dyadic dependencies as fixed effects and actor-specific dependencies as random effects. The influence of covariates are also considered in the analysis of cross-sectional, directed binary multiplex network data.
